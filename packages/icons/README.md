# Lido UI Icon set

> React icon set for Lido Finance projects.

## Adding a new icon

1. Place the `.svg` file to the `src/svg` folder.
2. Run `convert` script from the root repository folder: `yarn workspace @lidofinance/icons run convert` or from current folder: `yarn convert`

That's it. The new component should appear in the `src/index.tsx` file.
